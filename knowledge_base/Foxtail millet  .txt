Foxtail millet is generally grown as a rainfed crop in India and is seen in tropics as well as subtropical
regions both under low and moderate rainfall. The crop can be grown up to an altitude of 2000 metres
above mean sea level and in areas receiving 350-500 mm annual rainfall. It is a short duration crop (85

-100 days), important as food, feed and fodder crop.

It is mainly cultivated in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra

and a few north-eastern states. Grain is enclosed in thin hulls and de-hulling is necessary.

Health benefits

* Foxtail millet contains 12.3% protein, 60% carbohydrates of
which amylose is 11.1-16.5%, and 4.3% fat.

* The total dietary fiber content is in the range of 6-8%
depending on the level of dehulling and polishing.

* Dietary fiber content in foxtail millet is generally the highest
among the millets when polished moderately.

* The grain colour is slightly creamy when moderately
polished.
* Excess polishing should be avoided to retain health benefits of fiber.


* High fiber in diet is useful in slow digestion and slow release of sugars for diabetics.
* It also adds bulk to the food and helps in improvement of gastro-intestinal health.

Season

Foxtail millet growing season differs from state to state based-on environmental conditions.


* July in Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu, kharif irrigated crop is planted from the beginning of June to
end of July and rabi crop in August to September, summer irrigated crop in January.

* July-August in Karnataka.

* First fortnight of July in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

* Second and third week of July in Maharashtra.

* Plains of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, middle of June.

Spacing

Though spacing is depending on soil fertility status, Sowing time and variety, row to row 25-30 cm and
plant to plant 8-10 cm distance is advisable, and desired sowing depth is 2-3 cm.

Seed rate

* For line sowing recommended seééd rate is about 5-6 kg/ha (2.0 kg/acre)
* For broadcasting - 8-10 kg/ha (3-4 kg/acre)

Manuring and.fertilization

The crop is.usdally manured with 5 to 10 t/ha farm yard manure (FYM) about 2-3 weeks before sowing.
Generally, fertilizéfrecommendations to get a good crop are; 40 kg N, 20 kg P and 20 kg K per hectare.
Apply entire.quantity of P, K and half of N at sowing and remaining half of N at 25-30 days after sowing.

* Two inter cultivations and one hand weeding in line sowing is needed.

* Two hand weedings in broadcast crop and post-emergence application of 2, 4-D sodium salt
(80%) @ 1.0 kg a.i./ha at 20-25 DAS are required.

* Isoproturon @ 1.0 kg a.i. /ha as pre-emergence spray is also effective weeds control.

Cropping systems

Inter cropping

* Foxtail millet + groundnut (2:1),
* Foxtail millet + cotton (5:1),

* Foxtail millet + pigeon pea (5:1)

Relay cropping

Andhra Pradesh: If monsooniis early, sow foxtail millet at 45 cm row spacing and introduce Rabi jowar
as relay crop when foxtaikmillet ismearing maturity.

Sequence cropping

Foxtail millet-mustard, foxtail millet-green gram, foxtail millet-pigeon pea and foxtail millet sunflower

are profitablathamone crop of foxtail millet.

Diseases

Blast (Pyricularia setariae), Brown spot (He/mithosporium setariae), Rust (Uromyces setariae) appear on
the foliage.

Blast (Pyricularia setariae)

The young plants are highly susceptible to the disease. Symptoms are circular or oval shaped spot with
greyish centre surrounded by dark brown margin on leaf lamina. Under highly congenial conditions,
these spots enlarge and coalesce resulting in blasted appearance and causes considerable yield loss.

Control: Growing blast resistant cultivars, avoiding excess nitrogenous fertilizers. Spraying SAAF (0.2%)
or Carbendazim (0.05%) or Tricyclazole (0.05%) when the blast initial oms appears and need-based
second spray can be done after 10 days based-on disease severity.

Downy mildew (Sclerospora graminicola)

Primary infection causes yellowing of leaves of the plant and then, they turn whitish. The affected plant
rarely comes to flower. When the infection is mild, the plants may develop ear heads, but the floral
parts are turned into green leafy structures, hence the name “green ear”.

Control: Growing resistant cultivars, collection and removal of infected plant debris. Seed treatment
with Ridomil-MZ 72WP @ 3 g/kg of seed helps in eliminating seed borne infection and protects the
young seedlings from infection by the soil-borne inoculum. Spray of Ridomil-MZ @ 3 g/L water may
help to control the disease.

Rust (Mroamvees setariae\


2 ee ey ee ee ey

Diseased plants show numerous minute brown uredosori on both sides of the leaf. Rust pustules are
oblong, brown, often formed in linear rows. They are also produced on the leaf sheaths, culms and
stems. If the infection is severe, premature drying of leaves was observed and resulting in considerable

yield loss.
Control: Removal of collateral hosts and growing resistant\warieties. Spraying with Mancozeb @ 2.5 g/L

of water, immediately after observing the symptoms.

Pests
Shoot fly and its management

* Shootfly population can be monitored by fishmeal trap.
* Early sowing of crop i.e., second fortnight of July or with the onset of monsoon.
* Adopt higher seed rate(1.5 times of the recommended seed rate) to make up for seedling

mortality.
* Soil application of Carbofuran,.3G (10% granules) 8-10 kg/acre in furrow is effective in checking

shootfly infestation.

* Soil application of Carbofuron 3G (1.5 kg a.i/ha) is most effective in reducing shootfly incidence
before sowing at the time of field preparation.

* Spraying of Quinolphos (2 ml/L) effectively reduces shoot fly infestation.

Harvesting time

The crop matures in 80-100 days. The crop is harvested when the ear heads are dry, either by cutting
the whole plant by sickle or the ears separately. The crop is usually harvested during kharif season from

September to October and rabi season from January to February.

Yield

Grain yield is 20-25 q/ha and straw yield is 40-60 q/ha in normal condition.
