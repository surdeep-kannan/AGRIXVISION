Batley may be grown in subtropical climatic condition. The crop requires around 12-15 ac during
growingperiod and around 30 °C at maturity. It can not tolerate frost at any stage of growth and
incidence of frost at flowering at highly detrimental for yield. The crop posses vary high degree of

tolerance to drought and sodic condition.

Barley is mainly grown in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar,

Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Jammu Kashmir.

Soil Requirement

Barley is being grown in three distinct type of soil groups mainly Sandy Loam, Loam and Medium
& Heavy Black Soils. Sandy to moderately heavy loam soils of Indo-Gangetic plains having neutral
to saline reaction and medium fertility are the most suitable type for barley cultivation. However,
it may be grown on variety of soil types, viz, saline, sodic and lighter soils. Acidic soils are not fit

for barley cultivation, as such.

Land Preparation

Two to three ploughing with cultivator followed by planking after every ploughing. To save the
crop from Termite, Ants and other insect, seed treatment is advisable.

Manure and Fertilizers

Fertilser Requirement (kg./Ha.)

Production Condition


Nitrogen Pnospnorous

Irrigated Timely sown 60 30
Irrigated Late sown 60 30
Rainfed Plains 30 20
Rainfed Hilly Region 40 20

Add 10-20 cart loads of well rotten FarmeYard’Manure per ha.

In case of irrigated condition, half of the nitrogen and full dose of Phosphorous should be
applied as Basal and remaining half of the Nitrogen should be Top Dressed after first irrigation or
30 days after sowing, while in Case of light soils, one third of nitrogen and full dose of
Phosphorous should be applied as basal, one third of Nitrogen after first irrigation and rest one
third of Nitrogen after second irrigation.

Seeds and Sowing

Production Condition Seed rate (kg./Ha.) Time of Sowing Spacing (cm)
Irrigated Timely sown 100 10-25 November 23
Irrigated Late sown 125 26 Nov.-31 Dec. 18
Rainfed Plains 100 25 Oct.-10 Nov. 23
Rainfed Hilly Region 100 20 Oct.-7 Nov. rae

Method of sowing:

Sowing should be done in rows either by seed drill or behind the plough in furrows. Optimum

depth of sowing is 4.0 to 5.0cm.

Seed treatment

For the control; of Loose Smut disease, treatment with Vitavax or Bavistin @ 2 gm per Kg seed or
for the covered Smut treatment with 1:1 ratio mixture of Thiram + Bavistin or Vitavax @ 2.5 gm
per Kg seed. To avoid crop loss due to termite, seed treatment with 150 ml of Chloropyriphos (20
EC) or 250 ml Formathion (25 EC) in 5 liter of water for 100 Kg seed is recommended.

Irrigation:

Generally Barley crop require 2 to 3 irrigations for better yield. Depending opon the water
availability, suitable stages for irrigation should be identified.

Powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe graminis can be controlled by d using fine sulphur (200

mesh) @ 15 - 20 kg/ha or 1% Karathane. He/minthosporium leaf spot diseases can be effectively

controlled by spraying with copper fungicides or Dithane Z - 78.

Among the insect-pests, aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) can be controlled by spraying of Methyl
demeton 25 EC or Dimethoate 30 EC at 1,000 mi/ha or Imidacloprid 2 00 SL, at 100 ml/ha in 200 -
250 litres of water per ha. Systemic granular insecticides, viz. Phorate 10% or Disulfotan 5%


should be used in seed furrows @ 0.5 to 1 kg a.i./ha to control the pest.

Roguing

Roguing is must to maintain uniformity and purity of theWariety. Plants not conforming to the
morphological description of Sindhu are needed tbe promptly uprooted before harvesting.
Roguing is undertaken at boot or preflowering stage, followed by ane roguing at flowering and
final roguing at maturity.

Harvesting and Yield

Barley crop gets ready for harvest by the end of March to first fortnight of April. Since barley has
shattering character, it shouldbe harvested before over ripening to avoid breaking of spikes due
to dryness. Barley grain absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and should be stored at an
appropriate dry place to avoid\storage pest losses.

The average yieldof rain fed.crop ranges between 2,000 and 2,500 kg/ha, whereas that of
irrigated crop.is twice as much. Under favorable conditions of manuring and management
practices, improved varieties are capable of giving grain yield of 5 - 6 tonnes/ha under irrigated
timély sown conditions, from 3 to 3.5 tonnes/ha under late - sown conditions and from 2.5 to 3
tonnes/ha under rainfed conditions.
