Introduction

Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world’s population and it provides employment to
over one billion involved in -rice production. About 90% of the world’s rice is grown and consumed
in Asia. In India ricedS grownyin 44.15 million hectares and is the second largest producer of rice
in the world«with production of 116.47 million tons (2018-19) hence, plays vital role in food and
nutritional security and rural livelihood.

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) established All India Coordinated Research Projects
in, different crops to conduct multi-location tests and to assess their performance in different
regions or locations for release of varieties and hybrids. For rice, ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice
Research (formerly Directorate of Rice Research), Hyderabad is the nodal institute for carrying
out AICRIP related work.

Present status of rice

ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research (ICAR-IIRR) has adopted a unique model to facilitate joint
programme planning and implementation of multi-location testing along with exchange of
breeding and germplasm material. During the past 53 years (1966 to 2019), a total of 28837 elite
lines developed by different cooperating centres were tested in multi location trials across the
country under the umbrella of AICRIP. Till date, AICRIP was instrumental in release of 1410
varieties including 123 hybrids. A total of 301 varieties including 77 hybrids released by Central
Sub-Committee on Crop Standards, Notification and Release of varieties (CSCS & NRV) and 1109
varieties including 46 hybrids released through state variety release committees (SVRC) (Figure
1).

Among the 123 hybrids released, 33 are from public sector including three hybrids from ICAR-
IIRR (DRRH 1, DRRH 2 an@)DRRHg3) and 90 from private seed companies. Interestingly, Pusa RH
10 is the only public sector (ICAR-IARI, New Delhi) released basmati hybrid. ICAR-Indian Institute
of Rice Research is instrumental in release of India’s first zinc bio-fortified variety (DRR Dhan 45)
and a MAS bred variety with bacterial blight resistance (Improved Samba Mahsuri). In addition to
these, varieties with different traits have been developed and released from different research

organizations across India are listed in Table 1.
